        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>This game was designed as a part of a web programming course I took during my sophomore year in college. I was going for a game that was remniscient of classic arcade games such as Galaga and Space Invaders. I chose a minimalist design over the
            more traditional pixel art because I wanted to give the game a more modern feel.The game was programmed in Javascript, utilizing <a href="p5js.org" target="blank">p5js</a> as well as two of its libraries: p5dom and p5collide2d. The home page
            utilizes two fonts by Google: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Iceland" target="blank">Iceland</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu" target="blank">Ubuntu</a>.</p>
